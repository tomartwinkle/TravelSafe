# TravelBuddy: AI-Based Traffic Flow Optimization
This project was built in a 24 hour Hackathon Project - SRM Institute of Science and Technology, KTR Campus | January 2024 (Final Round)

## Problem Statement
AI-Based Traffic Flow Optimization with Real-Time Analysis, Signal Control, Rerouting, and Sustainable Development (Aligned with UN SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities)
## Overview 
TravelBuddy is an AI-powered traffic management solution developed to address the rising challenges of traffic congestion, inefficient signaling, high carbon emissions, and road safety concerns in urban environments, particularly in densely populated regions like India.
This project was designed and built during the SRM Hackathon 2024, with the goal of creating smarter and more sustainable transportation infrastructure by leveraging google maps API , kaggle datasets , real-time data analysis, AI-based optimization, and eco-conscious routing systems.
## Key Features
### 1. Real-Time Traffic Analysis
TravelBuddy integrates real-time traffic monitoring systems to collect and process live data from various traffic sources.

Uses this data to dynamically adapt routing suggestions and optimize traffic signal timings based on congestion levels.

### 2. Smart Signal Control and Optimization
AI-based control systems adjust signal durations based on real-time traffic density.

Reduces wait time at junctions and improves traffic flow efficiency.

Designed to adapt to changing traffic conditions, even during peak hours and emergencies.

### 3. Sustainable Rerouting
Implements rerouting logic using the Google Maps API.

Suggests fuel-efficient alternate paths by estimating carbon emissions for various routes.

Takes into account road infrastructure and live congestion data for optimized and sustainable travel.

Aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 by reducing environmental impact and improving urban mobility.

### 4. Accident Risk Mapping and Safety Alerts
Highlights accident-prone zones using real-time data and historical records.

Red zones are marked across the map, displaying accident frequency and nature of past incidents.

Increases driver awareness, especially in sensitive or high-risk areas.

A vital feature for India, where road safety is a pressing issue.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

- Backend: Python (Flask for APIs and AI logic)

- APIs and Tools:

Google Maps API (Routing and location data)

Kaggle traffic datasets 

Accident data analysis engine

- AI & Data Handling:

Python-based models for signal and route optimization

Carbon emission calculators and fuel-efficiency estimators

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with government traffic databases for more accurate real-time signal control.

- Incorporation of public transport routing and multimodal travel planning.

- Addition of weather-based rerouting, road block detection, and emergency vehicle prioritization.

- Further development of a mobile interface to expand accessibility and user engagement.
